# Digital Menu Application

## Case
The process in a restaurant is usually the same. Customers get seated, are hand over the menu, order drinks and food, consume the drinks and food and finally have dessert. A restaurant has a new idea to convert the above process to a digital experience. You will be developing the requested proof of concept in an agile fashion. Initially you'll focus on the MVP (the most important features) and then continue to flesh out the application.
